## Who am I?

Hi there! My name is Michele and I am here to learn. 

## What do I do?
I am currently working on my masters thesis, in which I employ ML-EAT to analyze political talk on Reddit. 

I am self thought, so things are going to be confusing! (e.g. this whole README.md - mostly me trying to figure out Github)

Almost there with the basics of Python, R will be my next adventure.
